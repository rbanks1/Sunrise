# Sunrise/Sunset

This is a P5.JS visualization showing 365 days of Sunrises and Sunsets. The goal was to create an image that provided motivation to get me through the long, dark winter months. It shows the days as they get longer/shorter, and when the sunrise and sunset times cross hour bands. It also includes a bunch of special events that might be good to look forward to. Finally, it includes the temperature as a coloured band through the middle.

It's currently very custom to where I live (Chertsey in the UK), with the Latitude and Longitude hard coded. Obviously, this needs to change.
